        <h2>Plants Are Alive!</h2>
        <h3>
            <p>So many people that I've talked too are fearful of keeping their plants alive. However it really is
                simple - if you've been out in the wind, you're sure to have a bad hair day! Plants are the same but
                they are tenacious and bounce back quickly! </p>
        </h3>

        <h2>It's Not Cheating</h2>
        <h3>
            <p>What is special about the pot is that it's designed to tell you how much water your plants have! Keep an
                eye on the MIN - MAX level! If it's been raining then you need to check your plants aren't being
                overwatered. If it's really hot, you'll need to top up more often. Not scary right? </p>

            and nature itself! Just wait, it won't be long until the ladybugs, bees and butterflies to begin visiting!
